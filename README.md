# scripts

try to save me time re-running bash commands

## set up 

0. [have node.js installed on your OS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

1. clone `scripts` repo

2. move into cloned dir (`cd scripts`)

3. make scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`

## usage

### create-react-stack 

the standard commands I run when creating a new pp

`./create-react-stack.sh your-app-name`

### delete .DS_STORE recursively

`./delete-dsstore.sh`

## note

I've only tested this on MacOS
